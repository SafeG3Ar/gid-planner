# GID the Planner

## Completed
GID the Planner will run on the following tech stack:
- Meteor JS Framework
- MongoDB
- React
- Material UI

The team has familiarized themselves with the new user interface framework *Material UI*. The mock up pages of the app have been discussed and created. The user interface outline of the app has been developed by the team. The following pages and components are completed:
- Task Form
- Calendar
- NavBar
- Template for Two-Factor Authentication
- All Collections

## Progress

From the last README.md update, we have created a "settings" page that enables users to edit their name and phone number if they wish to do so. We have also added a *Security* settings tab where the user is able to enable two-factor authentication if they choose to do so. The user also has the ability to disable two-factor authentication. The two-factor authentication implements Meteors accounts-2fa package, and also involves the use of third party 2FA applications such as DUO or Google Authenticator. To enable 2FA, the user must scan a QR code that is generated using a 2FA application. They will then be required to submit a code that the application provides them. Once submitted, 2FA for the user's account will be enabled, and the user is required to enter a code from the application every time they login.
